            <h3>Why Bali?</h3>
            <h2>Bali, the Land of the Gods</h2>
            <p>
              Also known as the Land of the Gods, Bali appeals through its sheer
              natural beauty of looming volcanoes and lush terraced rice fields
              that exude peace and serenity. It is also famous for surfersâ€™
              paradise!<br /><br />
              Bali enchants with its dramatic dances and colorful ceremonies,
              its arts, and crafts, to its luxurious beach resorts and exciting
              nightlife. And everywhere, you will find intricately carved
              temples. <br />
              <br />
              There are thousands of gift shops in Bali. From Denpasar to Ubud,
              you'll find many things you'd like to bring back home. Balinese
              signature souvenir range from delicious snacks and beverages, to
              the exquisite handcrafted goods like Tenun Bali. If you are
              thinking of bringing home souvenirs, your best bet is the souvenir
              market at Sukowati, where you may be overwhelmed by choice. Most
              of the starred hotels are located near the beach.

                <h4>Blue Point Beach</h4>
                <p>
                  Blue Point Beach, otherwise known as Suluban Beach, is hidden
                  behind rugged limestone formations in Pecatu, near Uluwatu.
                  Admittedly, getting here is something of an oceanic obstacle
                  course â€“ youâ€™ll access the sand via steps and log ramps that
                  traverse slim slits in the rocks â€“ but that just makes the
                  eventual dip in those waters more satisfying.
                </p>
                <h5>Address</h5>
                <p>Pecatu, South Kuta, Badung Regency, Bali</p>
                <h5>Why you should visit it</h5>
                <p>
                  Youâ€™ve probably never been to a hard-to-find Balinese
                  cave-beach before; change that here. Thanks to its vigorous
                  waves, Blue Point is well suited to surf sessions (less so to
                  swimming and sunbathing); itâ€™s also a popular spot for camping
                  and sunset bonfires.
                </p>

                <h4>Geger Beach</h4>
                <p>
                  Touted by some as southern Baliâ€™s most beautiful beach â€“ quite
                  the title, given the competition â€“ Geger is deliciously
                  secluded, just the right level of quiet, and home to calm,
                  safe waters.
                </p>
                <h5>Address</h5>
                <p>Benoa, South Kuta, Badung Regency, Bali</p>
                <h5>Why you should visit it</h5>
                <p>
                  This beach is perfect for swimmers, families and slower-paced
                  ocean adventures; if you want to try your hand (or legs) at
                  watersports, youâ€™re also in the right place. Keen golfers
                  could tie in a visit to the Nusa Dua Golf Course.
                  Nudity-loving sunbathers, take note; you can peel off your
                  bikini top here.

                <h4>Balangan Beach</h4>
                <p>
                  Balangan Beach is easily reached from Kuta, with many local
                  hotels offering a handy shuttle service. Itâ€™s also just a
                  kilometre away from another Balinese beach icon: Dreamland.
                  When you arrive, refresh yourself with ice cream and/or
                  ice-cold beer from one of the beachside warungs.

                <p>
                  Boasting more natural beauty than your average Brazilian
                  supermodel on a good day, Balangan has an eye-popping,
                  half-kilometre stretch of caramel-coloured sand, shielded by a
                  greenery-clad limestone cliff that snakes into the water like
                  a lounging crocodile.
