            <h3>Why Bali?</h3>
            <h2>Bali, the Land of the Gods</h2>
            <p>
              Also known as the Land of the Gods, Bali appeals through its sheer
              natural beauty of looming volcanoes and lush terraced rice fields
              that exude peace and serenity. It is also famous for surfersâ€™
              paradise!<br /><br />
              Bali enchants with its dramatic dances and colorful ceremonies,
              its arts, and crafts, to its luxurious beach resorts and exciting
              nightlife. And everywhere, you will find intricately carved
              temples. <br />
              <br />
              There are thousands of gift shops in Bali. From Denpasar to Ubud,
              you'll find many things you'd like to bring back home. Balinese
              signature souvenir range from delicious snacks and beverages, to
              the exquisite handcrafted goods like Tenun Bali. If you are
              thinking of bringing home souvenirs, your best bet is the souvenir
              market at Sukowati, where you may be overwhelmed by choice.
